## SpeakCount

This is a full react native app created for the SpeakCount project for the University of Twente.
The app will only work with the server created for it and the main react dashboard app for SpeakCount.

- Yarn install
- It's a detached app and therefor will only work if you link "react-native-sound-level" and "react-native-svg".
You can automaticaly link with the following: react-native link react-native-svg and react-native link react-native-sound-level

- For the Universtity of Twente: You can import the react native app to X-Code and Android Studio to deploy it on the app store.


SpeakCount is created for the University of Twente. Thanks to the algorithm on the server side you can compare the speaking time of each individual in a meeting in order to optimize the quality of a meeting. 

This project will be used as a case study at the university of Twente an even might be used for a PHD project.

SpeakCount has been created by several students from the Codaisseur Webdevelopment academy:
